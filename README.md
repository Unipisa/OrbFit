# SW_NAME Workbench

### This [SWHAPPE](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAPPE) workbench is for the acquisition of the source code of OrbFit, an astronomy library to compute orbits and ephemerides.

-------------------

This repository was created with the support of the 
[Software Heritage Acquisition Process Pisa Enactor](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAPPE) and contains the 
[Information on the acquisition process](https://github.com/Unipisa/OrbFit-Workbench/tree/master/metadata).

The original finds are stored in the [Depository](https://github.com/Unipisa/OrbFit-Depository) 
containing the
[raw materials](https://github.com/Unipisa/OrbFit-Depository/tree/master/raw_materials) and the
[browsable source](https://github.com/Unipisa/OrbFit-Depository/tree/master/browsable_source).

The resulting 
[development history](https://github.com/Unipisa/OrbFit/tree/SourceCode/) can be found in the [SW_NAME repository](https://github.com/Unipisa/OrbFit).

Please refer to the [SWHAPPE](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAPPE) guidelines.
