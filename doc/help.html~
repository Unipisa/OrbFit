What is OrbFit?</H3>
OrbFit is a software system allowing one to compute the orbits of asteroids
(soon also comets) starting from the observations, to propagate these orbits,
and to compute predictions on the future (and past) position on the celestial
sphere. It is a tool to be used to find a well known asteroid, to recover
a lost one, to attribute a small group of observations, to identify two
orbits with each other, to study the future (and/or past) close approaches
to Earth, thus to assess the risk of an impact, and more.
<P>&nbsp;OrbFit has been developed by a team of professional scientists,
working in the field of asteroid and comet dynamics, orbit determination,
nonlinear and chaotic dynamics, and astrometry. The composition of the
OrbFit consortium, and the motivations for this work, are described <A HREF="#authors">below</A>.
<P>&nbsp;OrbFit is free software, which means you can have your own copy
running on your computer at zero cost. However, the software is copyrighted,
and there are limitations to what you can do with it: most importantly,
you cannot incorporate it in products which you sell to others. More details
<A HREF="#licence">below</A>.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="testrun"></A>
<H3>
Can I test OrbFit?</H3> OrbFit is used as the engine of the online
information systems on numbered and multiopposition asteroids <A
HREF="http://hamilton.dm.unipi.it/astdys">AstDyS</A> and on Near Earth
Objects <A
HREF="http://newton.dm.unipi.it/neodys">NEODyS</A>. Specially adapted
versions of the same programs you can get from the free distribution
are used to establish and maintain daily a data base of orbits,
observations, and close approaches for all the objects with perihelion
at less than 1.3 Astronomical Units. By accessing this system you are
in fact using OrbFit.  <P>Moreover, special programs performing some
of the tasks of OrbFit have been set up in such a way that you can run
them directly from the web page (in computerese, these are
cgi-bin). You can ask for a prediction of an observation you would
like to perform tonight (also 20 years ago, looking at an old plate in
your archive), you can look at the target plane confidence boundary of
a very close approach to our planet, you can ask for ephemerides, and
more (the system is continuously improved, more or less in parallel
with the upgrades of OrbFit).  <P>Thus you can in fact test OrbFit
even before having a copy of the software on your computer. You can in
this way decide whether OrbFit is useful for you before wasting any
time with the download and installation procedure.  <BR>&nbsp;
<P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="get"></A>
<H3>
How to get?</H3>
OrbFit is available on the Internet through our web server. Thus you can have
all the software (source code, executables and documentation) and the data
files necessary to use it from our site.
<P><B>Dowloading instructions</B>
<P>&nbsp;From your web browser you should open the location (URL):
<P>&nbsp;<TT><A HREF="http://newton.dm.unipi.it/orbfit/">
http://newton.dm.unipi.it/orbfit/</A></TT>

<P>You are now offered the following choices:
<OL>

<LI> You can browse the directory structure, and have an idea of the
system, by entering in <TT><A HREF="http://newton.dm.unipi.it/orbfit/OrbFit/">
http://newton.dm.unipi.it/orbfit/</A></TT>

<LI> You can upload a <A HREF="/orbfit/unixtar.tar.gz"> tarball
</A> file containing a complete distribution for all UNIX systems
(including LINUX). The tarball contains all the necessary source files,
and the Makefiles for automated compilation on every UNIX system with
its own Fortran compiler.  You can also compile under WINDOWS
from the same sources, but you need to have the Fortran compiler Digital
Visual Fortran 6.0 installed on your computer.</LI>

<LI> You can upload a compiled version, ready to run under WindowsXX,
packed in a <A HREF="/orbfit/windows.zip"> zipfile</A>.
Once the archive (with a name such as <TT>OrbFit2_3_win.zip</TT>) is on
your hard disk, follow the WINDOWS installation procedure described <A
HREF="#instwin">below</A>.</LI>

<LI>
You can upload data files containing, e.g., catalogs of precomputed asteroid
orbits. This is in more detail described <A HREF="#inpdata">below</A>.</LI>
</OL>

<B>Upgrades</B>
<P>&nbsp;OrbFit is continuously updated and upgraded. The authors use modified
versions of the same software for their own research, and as soon as some
new algorithm has been validated, and the corresponding software has been
tested enough to be considered reliable, a new feature is added to the
OrbFit distribution. Moreover, small bugs are removed, and suggestions
from the users result in more user friendly interfaces. This results in
a new upgrade being available typically once every few months.

<P>&nbsp;Minor upgrades are such that a few new sources have to be added,
or maybe overwrite a previous source file. They are indicated with a patch
number, e.g. the first patch after distribution 2.3 shall be 2.3.1. Major
upgrades require to remove the old sources. 

<P>&nbsp;Although you are by no means obliged to upgrade, if you want
to do so you need to connect again to the <A
HREF="http://newton.dm.unipi.it/orbfit/"> distribution site</A> and
get the new archives containing the changed sources.  <P>In that
directory, their name is something like <TT>patch2.3.1.tar.gz</TT>.
Once this file is on your hard disk, use the <A
HREF="#upgrunix">upgrade procedure</A>.  In the WINDOWS directory, the
name of the archive is always <TT>widows.zip</TT>.
Download the archive, and repeat the <A HREF="#instwin">installation
procedure</A>.

<P><A NAME="install"></A>
<H3>
How to install?</H3>
The installation of OrbFit is highly automated, and should be easy. Please
let us know if you have difficulty or suggestions.
<P>&nbsp;The installation involves three steps: installation/compilation
of the executable programs, installation of the planetary ephemerides,
and tests. Under UNIX a special procedure is available to apply a minor
upgrade, stored in a patch file, without repeating the installation.

<P><A NAME="instunix"></A><B>UNIX installation</B>

<P>&nbsp;On a computer running a dialect of UNIX, you need to <TT>cd</TT> to the
directory where the archive <TT>OrbFit2.<I>N.N</I>.tar.gz</TT> has been
deposited, and unpack:
<PRE>$gunzip *.gz&nbsp;
$tar -xf OrbFit2.1.1.tar</PRE>
Then you have to configure for the specific Fortran compiler in use (each
compiler requires some non-standard flags): to do this you have to give
the command <TT>config</TT>. If you type <TT>config</TT> without arguments,
you get the online help:
<PRE>$ config
Usage: config [options] [configuration]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where options can be:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -d&nbsp; (debug)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -O&nbsp; (optimized)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -p&nbsp; (profiling)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and [configuration] is one of the following:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (HP PA RISC)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IBM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (IBM RISC 6000)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MIPS&nbsp;&nbsp; (MIPS, Silicon Graphics)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NAG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (NAG FORTRAN90 compiler)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SunOS&nbsp; (SunOS, Fortran 77/90)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fort77 (f2c through fort77 script)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (GNU g77 compiler)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ALPHA&nbsp; (Digital alpha f90 compiler)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HP90&nbsp;&nbsp; (HP Fortran 90)</PRE>
If you find either that compilation cannot be completed, or that the executable
does not perform as it should (e.g., it fails the tests), please let us
know exactly which processor, which version of UNIX, and which compiler
you were using. If, on the contrary, you succeed in compiling correctly
under some other configuration, please supply us the <TT>make.flags</TT>
file you have used and we will incorporate this into the <TT>config</TT>
utility.
<P>Having selected the configuration suitable for your hardware/operating
system environment, e.g. for Linux:
<BR>&nbsp;
<PRE>$ config -O g77
default library directory is /home/milani/orbfit/orb211/lib
default documentation directory is /home/milani/orbfit/orb211/doc</PRE>
you can proceed to the compilation, by giving the <TT>make</TT> command. For an
example of the output, see the file <TT><A HREF="README.compile">README.compile</A></TT>.
<P>&nbsp;For your convenience, all the executables <TT><I>progname</I>.x</TT>
have been linked from the directory <TT>./bin</TT>: to execute, you may
add this directory to your path. The location on your disk of the
<TT>./lib</TT>
and <TT>./doc</TT> directories, which need to be known by the executables,
have been set at compilation time, using the header files prepared by the
<TT>config</TT>
shell script.

<P>
<A NAME="jplephunix"></A><B>JPL Ephemerides installation under UNIX.</B>

<P>&nbsp;<I>(This section contains general information about the JPL
Ephemerides.  A few special instructions for WINDOWS are located <A
HREF="help.html#jplephwin">below</A>.)</I> <P>&nbsp;The dynamical
model of the Solar System used by OrbFit is based on the position of
the planets supplied by the so-called JPL ephemerides, created and
made public by the <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov">Jet Propulsion
Laboratory</A> (Pasadena, California). In order to use OrbFit you need
to install at least a part of the JPL ephemerides in
subdirectory<TT>./lib</TT>, under the name '<TT>jpleph</TT>', and in
binary form. Although, in principle you can use any of the currently
available releases (200, 403, 405), we recommend the latest one, that
is release 405.

<P>&nbsp;For the LINUX users who would like to have OrbFit up and running
immediately, we have prepared some binary ephemerides files. These can
be downloaded from this link <TT> 
<A HREF="http://newton.dm.unipi.it/orbfit/JPLEPH/">linux/jpleph</A></TT>.

<P>As an alternative, necessary if you want to run the program over a longer
time span, you can retrieve the JPL ephemerides in two ways: either by
purchasing a CDROM, or from the Internet. For the CDROM version you should
visit <A HREF="http://www.willbell.com">http://www.willbell.com</A>. There
you click on 'SOFTWARE' and on the image of a CDROM with JPL ephemerides.
There is plenty of information on the ephemerides themselves to be found
at the site, as well as an on-line ordering form.
<P>&nbsp;The other possibility is to retrieve the ephemerides directly
from the JPL FTP site. However, bear in mind that each package of ephemerides,
covering a period of 20 or 25 years, depending on the ephemerides release,
is typically about 6 MB in size. Thus, we recommend this method only for
partial installation (cf. for software testing purpose, in which case you
can download, say, only two packages, covering the period from 1950/60
to 2000), unless you have a very good network connection to JPL. In practice,
you can use the FTP facility of the Web browser by accessing <A HREF="ftp://navigator.jpl.nasa.gov/ephem/export">ftp://navigator.jpl.nasa.gov/ephem/export</A>
and you can also start an anonymous ftp session. We have prepared a <A HREF="jpl.ftp">sample
ftp session</A> to assist in obtaining the files this way.

<P>&nbsp;Once you have downloaded the ephemerides, you have to run the
<TT>asc2eph</TT>
conversion routine to produce a binary ephemerides file <TT>jpleph</TT>.
Starting with version 1.9.0 we are distributing a Makefile and suitably
modified Fortran files to assist with the task. See the file <TT><A HREF="../src/jpleph/README.OrbFit">src/jpleph/README.OrbFit</A></TT>
for more information. To test your ephemerides see the JPL
<TT>usrguide</TT>.

<P>&nbsp;<B>Test suite (UNIX)</B>

<P>&nbsp;You need first to set the appropriate symbolic link to JPL Digital
Ephemeris file in the lib/ directory:
<PRE>$ln -s /<I>somepath</I>/DE<I>nnn</I>.dat lib/jpleph</PRE>
and then give the command:
<PRE>$make tests</PRE>
The output should look like the example in the <TT><A HREF="README.tests">README.tests</A></TT>.
If it does not, please let us know.

<P><A NAME="upgrunix"></A><B>UNIX upgrade</B>

<P>&nbsp;Patches are as gzipped tar files, containing all the files which
are changed with respect to the last complete distribution (e.g. to apply
patch 2.1.2 you do <B>not</B> need to apply first the patch 2.1.1). In
order to install a patch, you have to untar the corresponding file in the
root directory of the software:
<PRE>$gunzip patch2.1.3.tar.gz
$tar -xf patch2.1.3.tar</PRE>
then erase obsolete files, no longer used, with the command:
<PRE>$make del_obsolete_files</PRE>
After that, it is necessary to rebuild from scratch the executables, using
the commands:
<PRE>$make clean
$make</PRE>
<A NAME="instwin"></A><B>WINDOWS installation</B>
<P>&nbsp;The Windows installation consists of four steps:
<OL>
<LI>
Download the appropriate <TT>.zip</TT> file from our site, by
pointing your web browser to the <TT><A
HREF="http://newton.dm.unipi.it/orbfit/">windows</A></TT> directory,

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
You must unzip the file from the compressed <TT>.zip</TT> format after
downloading to your hard drive. <B>The program must be unzipped to the
<TT>C:\</TT>
directory.</B> (This restriction may change in a later distribution.)</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;To unzip OrbFit you need one of several available programs.
We highly recommend the shareware program <A HREF="http://www.winzip.com">WinZip</A>,
but whatever you use, it should preserve long filenames. 


<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<A NAME="jplephwin"></A>Install JPL Ephemerides under WINDOWS. Remember that they must
be copied into C:\OrbFit\lib directory under the name <TT>jpleph</TT> .You can
use exactly the same procedure to obtain the JPL ephemerides (either as
a CDROM, or by anonymous ftp) from JPL, as described in the section <A HREF="#jplephunix">JPL
Ephemerides installation under UNIX.</A></LI>

<BR>&nbsp;Such a procedure, however, requires a good Fortran compiler
already installed on your WINDOWS computer. To make it possible even to
a user totally unfamiliar with Fortran to use our software, we have prepared
some ready made ephemerides files in a WINDOWS compatible binary. These
can be downloaded from this link 
<TT><A HREF="http://newton.dm.unipi.it/orbfit/JPLEPH/">windows/jpleph</A></TT>.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
Finally you should test the installation by executing the batch files 
<TT>tests\fitobs\testfit.bat</TT>
and
<TT>tests\orbfit\testorb.bat</TT>. Please note that you may not run
the tests or any other OrbFit programs simultaneously, as there will be
a sharing violation for the JPL Ephemerides, typically resulting in a system
crash. If you do encounter errors from these tests, and cannot solve the
problem, please <A HREF="help.html#bug_report">report</A> this to us as
a bug.</LI>
</OL>
Now you are ready to work. We suggest that you make a copy of your
<TT>tests</TT>
directory and use this copy as a work directory. The copy should not be
under the <TT>OrbFit</TT> directory, as this may be overwritten when you
install upgrades. Indeed, this work directory does not even need to be
on the same drive as the <TT>OrbFit</TT> directory.
<P>&nbsp;There is no WINDOWS upgrade procedure, because for WINDOWS we
distribute an executable, which needs to be replaced: to upgrade under
WINDOWS, just remove or rename the old <TT>OrbFit</TT> directory, and use
the installation procedure again.
<P><A NAME="instgnu"></A><B>GNUPLOT installation</B>
<P>&nbsp;The program fitobs provides the capability to produce plots of
several different kinds of data (elements for multiple solutions, close
approach analysis, observation prediction). This requires that the public
domain software GNUPLOT be available on your search path. The name of the
executable MUST be "gnuplot". You may obtain GNUPLOT at the Dartmouth <A HREF="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/gnuplot_info.html">GNUPLOT
page</A>.
<P>&nbsp;NOTE: On our Windows installation we have successfully tested
the GNUPLOT distribution <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dartmouth.edu/pub/gnuplot/gnuplot3.7cyg.zip">gnuplot3.7cyg.zip</A>
available at the Dartmouth site. Since the name of the executable MUST
be "gnuplot", we have simply made a second copy of the original program
under the proper name:
<PRE>copy wgnuplot.exe gnuplot.exe</PRE>
To ensure that the program is on your search path, you can add a line similar
to the following to your autoexec.bat and then execute autoexec.bat (or
perhaps reboot).
<PRE>SET PATH = "C:\Program Files\Gnuplot\" ; "%PATH%"</PRE>
(This is for Win95/98. On Windows NT, the command would be the same, but
without quotes.)

<P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="start"></A>
<H3>
How to start?</H3>
OrbFit consists of three main programs: Orbfit, Fitobs, and Bineph.
<P>&nbsp;Orbfit is a batch only, no questions asked by program. It can even
run with no input options file, just by giving the asteroid name in the
standard input (but you need to have the files with the data). Look at
the <TT>*.oop</TT> files provided in the <TT>./tests/orbfit/</TT> directory
as examples.
<P>&nbsp;Fitobs is a menu driven, interactive program, which allows a surprising
variety of data processing procedures. Use it on some of the examples supplied
in the <TT>./tests/fitobs</TT> directory to learn: you need only to change
the <TT>*.fop</TT> file to run your own test case. Use the online help
at each menu.
<P>&nbsp;Bineph is used to add perturbations from other asteroids to the
dynamic model: to be used only for top accuracy.
<P>&nbsp;<B>What you need to start</B>
<P>&nbsp;To begin working with OrbFit, you need exactly three things:
<UL>
<LI>
the executables for the main programs fitobs, orbfit (and possibly bineph),</LI>

<LI>
the files containing the input data,</LI>

<LI>
an idea of what you want to do.</LI>
</UL>

The executables are stored on your hard disk by the <A
HREF="#install">installation procedure</A>. What you can do is
outlined in the <A HREF="#cando">next section</A>. In the rest of this
section we shall describe the input files, and how to procure them.
<P>&nbsp;<B>Input data files</B> <P>To understand the input data files
that you need, you have to bear with us for a small bit of
theory. When an asteroid/comet is discovered, some <B>observations</B>
become available, but the <B>orbit </B>is not known. Once the orbit
has been computed by fitting the observations, it can be propagated to
an epoch different from the one of the observations, provided a
<B>dynamic model </B>of the Solar System is available. Thus there are
exactly three types of data files you might need to run OrbFit:
<BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;
<OL>
<LI>
An observation file, containing the position of one asteroid/comet on the
sky at different times, as recorded by some observatories. In the OrbFit
system, these files have names such as
<TT><I>astname</I>.rwo</TT>, <TT><I>astname</I>.obs</TT>,
<TT><I>astname</I>.rad</TT>,
and they are stored in some directory
<I><TT>obsdir</TT></I>.</LI>

<LI>
An orbital elements file <I><TT>elefil</TT></I>, containing either the
sets of six numbers defining the orbit of one object at some epoch, or
possibly a list of orbital elements for many asteroids and/or comets (a
so called <B>orbit catalog</B>).</LI>

<LI>
Files allowing to compute the positions of all the bodies which can, with
their gravitational attraction, change the orbit of the asteroids/comets.
These files specify the dynamic model of the Solar System to be used for
orbit propagation. The positions of the planets are provided by the JPL
ephemerides, which are installed on your hard disk as part of the 
<A HREF="#jplephunix">installation
procedure.</A> If you need to take into account even the gravitational
pull of some asteroids for extremely accurate computations you must generate
the corresponding <A HREF="#bineph">ephemerides files using bineph</A>.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;</OL>
The instruction on how to procure the input data files are below: let us
now assume you have them. Then the only requirement to be able to start
one of the OrbFit main programs is to write an option file, which specifies
where the input data files are.
<P>As an example, for the <B>fitobs</B> main program, this is an input
file, named 1978CA.fop:
<PRE>! option file for fitobs
fitobs.
! input data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .astna0='1978 CA'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ! full name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .obsdir0='observations'&nbsp; ! directory of observs. file&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .elefi0='elems/1978CA.eq0'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ! orbital elements file
!</PRE>
Note that everything after an exclamation mark is just a comment. Thus
there are in fact only four significant lines, specifying
<OL>
<LI>
that options are being given for the fitobs program</LI>

<LI>
that the asteroid under consideration is 1978 CA</LI>

<LI>
that the observations, if any, are in the subdirectory
<TT>observations</TT>
of the current directory where the program is run; the file names are <TT>1978CA.obs</TT>
and/or <TT>1978CA.rwo</TT></LI>

<LI>
that the orbital elements for that asteroid are to be found in a file <TT>1978CA.eq0</TT>
in the subdirectory <TT>elems</TT> of the current directory.</LI>
</OL>
Many more options can be set in the .fop file, but these are the only ones
you need to specify. Do not mind the "0" at the end of the variable names
(<TT>astna0, obsdir0, elefi0</TT>): this is just because fitobs can handle
two asteroids at the same time, in which case you should specify also <TT>astnap,
obsdirp, elefip</TT>.
<P>Now the instructions to run <B>fitobs</B> for 1978 CA are as follows
(under UNIX): from the command line type the name of the executable: <TT>fitobs.x</TT>
and then, when prompted for the <I>runname</I>, just type the name of the
<TT>.fop</TT>
file (<B>without</B> the <TT>.fop</TT> extension), in this case: <TT>1978CA</TT>
(blanks do not matter). Then fitobs is up and running, with all the input
data read and available: from then on, use the menus, making use of the
online help at each menu as necessary by typing "-1".
<P>&nbsp;If the <TT>fitobs.</TT> options are not specified or the
<TT>*.fop</TT>
file is missing, default values will be used. In particular, the program
will use the run name as the asteroid name, looking for an intitial orbit
in the file <TT>./ast.cat</TT> and for observations in the directory <TT>./obsdata/</TT>.
<P>&nbsp;To use the batch mode program <B>orbfit</B> is even simpler: the
file
<TT><I>runname</I>.oop</TT> has both the function of specifying the
input files and of specifying what you want the program to do, but there
are default file names and default actions such that in many cases you
do not need to specify anything. As an example, if the file
<TT>1978CA.obs</TT>
is available in the current directory, and you type <TT>orbfit.x</TT> followed,
at the prompt for run name, by 1978CA, then orbfit will run and compute
an orbit for 1978 CA even without an <TT>.oop</TT> file: the output orbital
elements file will have the default name
<TT>1978CA.oel</TT>.
<P>&nbsp;Both for orbfit and for fitobs the availability of an orbital
elements file is not mandatory, since both programs can compute an orbit
from the raw observations only, as the above example shows. Vice versa,
if an orbit is available from some orbit catalog, the observations are
not always required: e.g. it is possible to propagate the orbit, to generate
ephemerides, and so on, although the quality of the results will depend
upon the quality of the orbit supplied, and it might not be up to the accuracy
standards of the OrbFit system.
<P><A NAME="inpdata"></A><B>How to procure input data files</B>
<P>&nbsp;For each one of the three types of input data files, there are
online Internet resources.
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
Catalogs of asteroid (and comets) orbits can be obtained from at least
three sources:</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<OL>
<LI>
the Lowell Observatory asteroid orbits data base
<TT>astorb.dat.gz</TT>,
available by anonymous ftp from <TT><A HREF="ftp://ftp.lowell.edu/pub/elgb/">ftp://ftp.lowell.edu/pub/elgb</A></TT>.</LI>

<LI>
the Minor Planet Center Extended Computer Service, with Web access at <TT><A HREF="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/services/WebCSAccess.html">http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/services/WebCSAccess.html</A></TT>.
However, note that at present this is a service reserved to paying customers.</LI>

<LI>
the catalogs of orbits computed by ourselves, using OrbFit, are available
from <TT><A HREF="http://hamilton.dm.unipi.it/astdys/catalogs/">AstDyS</A></TT></LI>

<LI>
individual orbit files, updated daily, for near-Earth asteroids may be
obtained from the <A HREF="http://newton.dm.unipi.it/neodys">NEODyS</A>
online information system.</LI>
</OL>
For all three sources described above, the format of the orbit catalog
files is automatically detected by the OrbFit input routines: you do not
need to specify the source of the data, but only give
<TT>elefil</TT>,
that is where you have placed the file you have downloaded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
The observations can be input in OrbFit in three formats, the <TT>.obs</TT>,  <TT>.rwo</TT> 
and <TT>.rad</TT> files.</LI>

<OL>
<LI>
The <TT>.obs</TT> files, in the format specified by the Minor Planets Center,
are currently available from the MPC Extended Computer Service at <TT><A HREF="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/services/WebCSAccess.html">http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/services/WebCSAccess.html</A></TT>.
However, note that at present this is a service reserved to paying customers.</LI>

<LI>
The <TT>.rwo</TT> files produced by OrbFit are available from us, 
through the online information systems <A HREF="http://hamilton.dm.unipi.it/astdys">AstDyS</A>.
and <A HREF="http://newton.dm.unipi.it/neodys">NEODyS</A>.
All the data on the objects of this class are available, including not
only the raw data, but the output of our processing.</LI>

<LI>
The <TT>.rad</TT> files contain radar astrometry. This data may be obtained
from JPL at <A HREF="http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/radar_data.html">http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/radar_data.html</A>.
The data must be organized into separate files with the form
<TT><I>astname</I>.rad</TT>
where <I>astname</I> is the number or temporary designation of the object.
Each record in the <TT>.rad</TT> file should include only the first 100
columns from the file published by JPL and blank lines must be removed.
A few examples are provided in the <A HREF="../tests/fitobs/obsdata">./tests/fitobs/obsdata</A>
directory.</LI>

<LI>
Most observers would be willing to provide you with their own observations,
typically in the MPC format, suitable for
<TT>.obs</TT> files.</LI>

What can I do with OrbFit?</H3>
We need again to stress the different approaches used by <TT>fitobs</TT> and 
<TT>orbfit</TT>.
<TT>Fitobs</TT> is menu driven, meant to allow the user do decide interactively
what to do with the available data, depending upon the results of the previous
steps. There is an options file
<I>runname</I>.fop, but it only provides
the location of the input data files. <TT>Orbfit</TT> is a batch program, in which
all the actions are predetermined either by the <I>RUNNAME</I>.oop options
file, or by defaults depending upon which data files are available.
<P>&nbsp;<B>Fitobs</B>
<P>In <TT>fitobs</TT>, after launching the program and supplying the
<I>runname</I>,
the main menu is accessed. Online help is available by answering "-1" to
each menu: the <A HREF="mainmenu.help">main menu help file</A> proposes
a wide choice of possible actions. You are advised to often use the status
menu item, not to loose the account of what you have already done, e.g.
which orbits you have already computed, up to which epoch they have been
propagated, and so on.
<P>&nbsp;Just to give you a feeling of the possibilities, a list of possible
actions with <TT>fitobs</TT> is as follows:
<UL>
<LI>
preliminary orbit computation from 3 observations</LI>

<LI>
differential corrections, that is orbit improvement by least squares fit
to the observations, with automatic/manual outlier rejection</LI>

<LI>
state propagation and orbital elements time series</LI>

<LI>
predictions of observations, with confidence boundary</LI>

<LI>
close approach analysis, with confidence boundary</LI>

<LI>
identification of two sets of observations with a single object</LI>
</UL>
However, only those actions for which the necessary data are available
are admitted: e.g., if data are been supplied only for one asteroid (the
<I>first
arc</I> quoted in many menus), then to ask to do anything on the second
one results in a negative message, followed by a return to the menu from
which the request was issued. The program <TT>fitobs</TT> should almost never crash
(if you succeed in crashing it, let us know how), but just refuse to do
what is not possible.
<P>&nbsp;<B>Orbfit</B>
<P>&nbsp;<TT>Orbfit</TT> can do most of the same actions available in <TT>fitobs</TT>, 
e.g. preliminary orbits, differential corrections, identifications, ephemerides.
However, the sequence of actions is predetermined, the option file can
be used to jump some of the steps. The list of possible options is huge,
as can be seen in the commented <A HREF="README.options">options file</A>,
but in most cases a very simple option file is enough, as can be seen in
the examples in the ./tests/orbfit directory. The file 
<A HREF="../tests/orbfit/README.examples">README.examples</A>
discusses these examples.

Graphical interface.</H3>
For your convenience we have implemented a graphical interface "OrbFitSoft"
in Orbfit (Linux only), which is supposed to facilitate usage of the
entire system. You can run all the programs contained in the package and
make use of the complete, online help, available even while other programs
are running.
<P>&nbsp;We assume that you have a Tcl/Tk package installed, and that 'wish'
shell is in '/usr/bin/'. If this is not the case you can either set an
appropriate link, or you can edit all the executables in the 'doc/' subdirectory
of Orbfit (OrbFitSoft, HELP, ORBFIT, FITOBS, BINEPH) and change the first
line in each of them to reflect the location of 'wish' on your system.
<P>&nbsp;This application is developed using version 8.0 of 'wish'. To
learn more on Tcl/Tk consult either the online 'tclhelp' facility, available
in '/usr/bin/' on your machine, or the book "Tcl and the Tk Toolkit" by J.K.Ousterhout
(Adison-Wesley Publ.Comp.).
<P>&nbsp;To use "OrbFitSoft" just invoke it from the command line in your
working directory. You should, however, first set a couple of links in
your working directory (links are already provided in all the 'tests/<I>NAME</I>'
subdirectories); if, for example, the working directory is 'home/zoran/workdir',
and Orbfit is installed in '/home/zoran/orbfit', then you should:
<PRE>$ cd /home/zoran/workdir
$ ln -s ../orbfit/doc/OrbFitSoft
$ ln -s ../orbfit/src/include/doclib.h</PRE>
Your graphical interface is now fully operational and you can type
<PRE>$ OrbFitSoft</PRE>
to invoke it. If you lose contents of the windows when you drag them from
one place on the screen to another or overlap one window with another then
you should not run OrbFitSoft in the background. Usage of the interface
is simple and essentially self-explanatory (for additional information
see also "Help on Help" in menu "ABOUT" of the help facility). Note, however,
that the parent 'xterm' window from which you invoke OrbFitSoft will be
grabbed by the application and not released until you exit from the graphical
interface. Thus, all the screen output of the current program is going
to appear in this window. Also you will not get the prompt back in this
window after launching any of the jobs, even when the current job ends
(thus do not wait for the prompt to learn that the job is over, but there
will be an execution time report), until you release it by exiting the
interface. Still, you can relaunch the current job, or launch any other
job by simply clicking on the corresponding menu item in the top-level
"AstOrb" window. If you need to do something else while the application
is running, you should open another 'xterm' window.
<P>&nbsp;Help is available even while other programs are running. Other
programs (orbfit, fitobs, bineph) should preferably run one at a time,
as their outputs would otherwise be all mixed up in the same window.
<P>&nbsp;The automatic placement of the interface windows is optimized
for a 17-inch screen, with 1024 x 768 resolution. If you have problems
with the positioning of the window and/or the menus (submenus getting out
of the screen), just edit the last line of the corresponding file (see
above for the list of executables), which shoud be something like:
<PRE>wm geometry . +160+20</PRE>
and change the numbers (in pixels on the display counting from the upper-left
corner) until you find an appropriate position for the window on your screen.

<H3>
What is new?</H3>
OrbFit is always a work in progress, to the point that to document what
has just been done is difficult, not to speak of what is planned.The only
way to provide you with some reasonably up to date information is to give
you access to two files that are more or less continuously maintained.
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="README.patches">README.patches</A> is the file where we note the
most recent corrections and improvements since the previous full distribution,
plus those not yet incorporated in a full distribution, but already available
in the last patch.</LI>

ask how soon, because we would like to know ourselves!</LI>
</UL>

<HR>
<P><A NAME="authors"></A>
<H3>
Who writes OrbFit and why?</H3>
The authors of the OrbFit software are scientists working in the field
of celestial mechanics, with specific experience of dynamics and orbit
determination for both natural celestial bodies (asteroids, comets, satellites,
planets) and artificial spacecraft (satellites, interplanetary probes).
<P>&nbsp;We write, and use for our own research, tens of thousands of lines
of software. We have developed computer programs capable of performing
many tasks, and these programs are often used only once, for a specific
research goal. This happens because to export a software, writing all the
necessary documentation, taking care of the possible machine dependencies,
and writing the control software necessary to build and test, is a significant
additional work.
<P>There are, however, two good reasons to do this supplementary effort.
First, we write software which could be useful to others, both researchers
and interested amateur astronomers. Our work could have more value to the
astronomical community if it is used extensively. This is important if
our software allows some amateur astronomers (and possibly some small professional
observatories) to perform tasks for which they do not have the resources
to develop their own software. This is especially useful in the field of
asteroid orbit determination and improvement, where a significant contribution
to the global flow of observations is given by amateur and small professional
observatories.
<P>Second, one of the main principles of the scientific method is reproducibility
of all results of the research. In our times, when most computations are
performed by complex computer programs, to outline the algorithm used in
papers submitted for publication is useful, but is not always enough to
enable others to really verify the results. The only way to achieve total
scientific transparency (<I>glasnost</I>) is to make the source code of
the computer programs open to inspection by other scientists. Thus we follow
the principle that not only the algorithms, but even the actual subroutines
we have used in our recent research should become, immediately after publication
of the results, available to the public. In fact this obligation to transparency
forces us to raise the level of quality of our research, and the reliability
of the results.

<B>How do I force statistical weighting of optical artrometry?</B></DT>

<BR>&nbsp;

The default weighting scheme weights most modern optical astrometry at
1 arc-sec a priori RMS. This can be changed to apply weights based on the
station's historical performance by adding the following options to the
option file:</DD>

<B>I am having trouble with initial orbit determination. What can I do?</B></DT>

<BR>&nbsp;
<DD>
You can edit the *.rwo file and set the SEL (selection) flag (last column)
to 2 in order to select which three optical observations you wish to use
in the initial orbit determination. The software tries to select these
for you, but in some cases it does a poor job. If you find failure with
the automatically selected observations, you may reset those SEL flags
to 1 and choose three alternatives, which should be set to 2. Typically
this works best if the three observations are equally distributed over
an arc of 7-10 days.</DD>

<BR>&nbsp;
<DT>
<B>What does the error "ra15v: non convergence with fixed step" mean?</B></DT>

<BR>&nbsp;
<DD>
This probably indicates that the propagator is trying to take too large
of a step during a close approach. Usually this problem can be solved by
increasing the value for .npoint in the option file (*.fop or *.oop):</DD>
